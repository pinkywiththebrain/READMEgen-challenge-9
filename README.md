  ## Description
  In this challenge I was instructed to create a README generator using Javascript, Node.js, as well as the npm package Inquirer. I used the completed generator to make this very README!
  
  ## Installation Instructions
  Must download the inquirer package in order to use.
  
  ## Usage
  After submitting "node index" into the command line, the user is given several prompts to answer. Once they finish answering the prompts the generator will provide them with a README.md file that displays all the information they gave.
